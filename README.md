# Raspberry Pi Private Cloud

## Overview

The Raspberry Pi Private Cloud project aims to create a private cloud solution using Raspberry Pi devices. By leveraging load balancing techniques, this project distributes the data load efficiently across multiple Raspberry Pi nodes. Built using Java, Servlets, SQL, and Raspberry Pi hardware, this project offers a cost-effective and customizable private cloud solution for personal or small-scale use.

## Key Features

- **Private Cloud Infrastructure**: Utilize Raspberry Pi devices to establish a private cloud environment.
- **Load Balancing**: Implement load balancing techniques to distribute data load effectively across Raspberry Pi nodes.
- **Scalability**: Easily scale the private cloud infrastructure by adding or removing Raspberry Pi nodes as needed.
- **Data Security**: Ensure data security and privacy by hosting files and services within a controlled environment.
- **Customizable**: Tailor the private cloud setup to meet specific requirements and preferences.
